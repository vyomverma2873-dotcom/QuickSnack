## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If Deployment Fails

**Check Logs:**
1. Go to Render Dashboard → Logs
2. Look for error messages

**Common Issues:**

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "EMAIL_PASS not defined" | Add EMAIL_PASS in environment variables |
| "Authentication failed" | Verify app password is correct |
| "Email server not ready" | Check all SMTP settings are correct |
| "Build failed" | Check if nodemailer is in package.json |

### If Emails Not Sending

1. **Check Render Logs:**
   ```
   Look for: "✅ Email sent successfully via Nodemailer!"
   Or errors: "❌ Nodemailer email sending failed!"
   ```

2. **Verify Environment Variables:**
   - EMAIL_USER = vyomverma2873@gmail.com
   - EMAIL_PASS = qwlkaatwfvwfipxq (no spaces)
   - SMTP_HOST = smtp.gmail.com
   - SMTP_PORT = 587

3. **Check Gmail Account:**
   - 2FA is enabled
   - App password is active
   - IMAP is enabled

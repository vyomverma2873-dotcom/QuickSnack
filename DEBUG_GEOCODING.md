# Debugging Geocoding Issue

## What I've Added

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling
- Detailed logging for all reverse geocoding requests
- Better error messages for different failure types
- Coordinate validation before making API calls

### 2. Axios Fallback
- If axios fails to load, the code falls back to Node.js built-in `https` module
- This ensures the API works even if there are dependency issues

### 3. Health Check Endpoint
- New endpoint: `/api/places/health`
- Tests if axios is working and provides system information

### 4. Debug Information
- All requests and responses are logged to console
- Error details include status codes and network information

## How to Debug

### Step 1: Check Health Endpoint
Visit: `https://your-backend-url.onrender.com/api/places/health`

This will tell you:
- If axios is working
- Node.js version being used
- If HTTP requests are working at all

### Step 2: Check Backend Logs
1. Go to your Render dashboard
2. Open your backend service
3. Check the "Logs" tab
4. Look for detailed error messages when you try location detection

### Step 3: Test Reverse Geocoding Directly
Try making a direct request to test the endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-backend-url.onrender.com/api/places/reverse-geocode \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"lat": 28.6139, "lng": 77.2090}'
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Deployment Still in Progress
- **Solution**: Wait 5-10 minutes for Render to complete deployment
- **Check**: Look for "Deploy succeeded" in Render logs

### Issue 2: Node.js Version Issue
- **Solution**: The new code should force Node.js 18
- **Check**: Health endpoint shows Node.js version

### Issue 3: Axios Installation Failed
- **Solution**: The fallback https module should work
- **Check**: Health endpoint shows `axios_working: false` but still works

### Issue 4: Network/Firewall Issues
- **Solution**: Render might be blocking external requests
- **Check**: Look for "ENOTFOUND" or "ETIMEDOUT" errors in logs

## Next Steps

1. **Wait for deployment** (5-10 minutes)
2. **Check health endpoint** to see system status
3. **Try location detection** again
4. **Check Render logs** for detailed error information
5. **Report back** with any error messages you see

The enhanced logging will show exactly what's happening when the geocoding fails!

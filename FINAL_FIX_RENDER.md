# ✅ FIXED: Render Email Timeout Issue

## 🔍 Problem Found

## 🚀 Update Render Dashboard

### IMPORTANT: Update SMTP_PORT in Render

1. **Go to:** https://dashboard.render.com
2. **Select:** `quicksnack-backend`
3. **Click:** Environment tab
4. **Find:** `SMTP_PORT`
5. **Change from:** `587`
6. **Change to:** `465`
7. **Click:** "Save Changes"

### All Environment Variables Should Be:

```env
EMAIL_USER=vyomverma2873@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=qwlkaatwfvwfipxq
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=465          ← CHANGE THIS!
NODE_ENV=production    ← Make sure this is correct too
```

## ⏱️ Wait for Deployment

After saving:
1. Render will auto-deploy from GitHub (takes 2-5 minutes)
2. OR manually trigger deployment
3. Wait for "Live" status

### Check Logs:

Look for these messages:
```
✅ Email server is ready to send messages
✅ Connected to MongoDB Atlas
✅ QuickSnack server running on 0.0.0.0:10000
```

**Should NOT see:**
```
❌ Connection timeout
❌ Email transporter verification failed
```

---

## 🧪 Test Production

### Step 1: Wait for Deployment

- Status shows "Live" (green)
- Logs show "Email server is ready"
- No timeout errors

### Step 2: Test on Vercel App

1. Go to your Vercel deployment
2. Try login/signup with any email
3. Check email inbox (and spam folder!)
4. You should receive OTP!

### Step 3: Verify in Logs

After testing, check Render logs for:
```
📧 Attempting to send email to: user@example.com
✅ Email sent successfully via Nodemailer!
   Message ID: <xxxxx@gmail.com>
   Response: 250 2.0.0 OK
```

## 📊 Port Comparison

| Port | Protocol | Render Support | Status |
|------|----------|----------------|--------|
| 587  | TLS/STARTTLS | ❌ Blocked/Timeout | Not working |
| 465  | SSL | ✅ Works | **Use this!** |
| 25   | Plain | ❌ Blocked | Don't use |

**Port 465 with SSL is the most reliable for Render!**

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If Still Getting Timeout:

1. **Double-check SMTP_PORT in Render:**
   - Must be exactly: `465`
   - Not: `587` or anything else

2. **Verify All Settings:**
   ```
   SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
   SMTP_PORT=465
   EMAIL_USER=vyomverma2873@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASS=qwlkaatwfvwfipxq
   ```

3. **Check Logs:**
   - Look for "Email server is ready"
   - Should NOT see "Connection timeout"

### If Authentication Fails:

1. Generate new app password
2. Update EMAIL_PASS in Render
3. Redeploy

## 📞 Technical Details

### Why Port 465 Works Better:

1. **Direct SSL connection** - More reliable
2. **Fewer firewall issues** - Port 465 is standard for SMTPS
3. **Better for cloud platforms** - Render, Heroku, etc. prefer 465
4. **Immediate encryption** - No STARTTLS negotiation needed

### Configuration:

```javascript
{
  host: 'smtp.gmail.com',
  port: 465,
  secure: true,  // SSL enabled
  auth: {
    user: 'vyomverma2873@gmail.com',
    pass: 'qwlkaatwfvwfipxq'
  },
  connectionTimeout: 10000,
  greetingTimeout: 10000,
  socketTimeout: 10000
}
```

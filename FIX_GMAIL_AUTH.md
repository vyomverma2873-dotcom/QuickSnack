## ‚úÖ Solution Steps

### Step 1: Verify 2-Factor Authentication is Enabled

1. Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/security
2. Sign in with: **officialvyom@gmail.com**
3. Look for "2-Step Verification"
4. **It MUST be turned ON** to generate app passwords

If it's OFF:
- Click "2-Step Verification"
- Follow the setup process
- Add your phone number
- Complete verification

---

### Step 2: Generate a NEW App Password

**IMPORTANT:** You must generate a fresh app password!

1. Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
   - Or: Google Account ‚Üí Security ‚Üí App passwords

2. Sign in with: **officialvyom@gmail.com**

3. Click "Select app" ‚Üí Choose "Mail" or "Other (Custom name)"
   - If choosing "Other", type: **QuickSnack**

4. Click "Select device" ‚Üí Choose "Other (Custom name)"
   - Type: **QuickSnack Backend**

5. Click "Generate"

6. **Copy the 16-character password** (it will look like: `abcd efgh ijkl mnop`)
   - **IMPORTANT:** Copy it EXACTLY as shown (with or without spaces)

7. **DO NOT close the window** until you've saved it!

---

### Step 3: Update .env File

Open: `/Users/prakritiverma/Desktop/QuickSnack/backend/.env`

Update the EMAIL_PASS line with the NEW password (remove all spaces):

```env
EMAIL_PASS=abcdefghijklmnop
```

**Example:**
- If Google shows: `abcd efgh ijkl mnop`
- You should write: `EMAIL_PASS=abcdefghijklmnop`

---

### Step 4: Test Again

```bash
cd backend
node test-nodemailer.js
```

**Expected output:**
```
‚úÖ Email sent successfully!
   Message ID: <xxxxx@gmail.com>
```

## üîç Alternative: Check Gmail Settings

### Option 1: Enable IMAP (Required for SMTP)

1. Go to: https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#settings/fwdandpop
2. Sign in with: **officialvyom@gmail.com**
3. Click "Forwarding and POP/IMAP" tab
4. Under "IMAP access", select **"Enable IMAP"**
5. Click "Save Changes"

### Option 2: Check "Less secure app access" (Usually not needed)

**Note:** This is deprecated by Google, but check just in case:

1. Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps
2. If it shows a toggle, turn it ON
3. **However**, with 2FA + App Password, this should NOT be needed

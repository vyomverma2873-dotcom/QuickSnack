# Git Push Instructions for QuickSnack

## Current Status
✅ Repository initialized
✅ All changes committed locally
✅ Ready to push to remote repository

## Option 1: If you have an existing GitHub repository

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` and `YOUR_REPO_NAME` with your actual GitHub details:

```bash
# Add remote repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git

# Push changes to remote repository
git push -u origin main
```

## Option 2: Create a new GitHub repository

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and create a new repository
2. Copy the repository URL (e.g., `https://github.com/yourusername/QuickSnack.git`)
3. Run these commands:

```bash
# Add remote repository (replace with your actual URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/QuickSnack.git

# Push changes to remote repository
git push -u origin main
```

## Option 3: If using Render's Git integration

If your Render deployment is connected to a specific repository, make sure to push to that same repository so Render can automatically redeploy.

## After Pushing

Once you push the changes:
1. **Render will automatically detect the changes** (if connected to the repository)
2. **Automatic redeployment** will begin
3. **The geocoding fix will be live** after successful deployment
4. **Test the location detection feature** in your app

## Verification

After deployment, test these features:
- Auto-detect location button
- Manual location search
- Reverse geocoding functionality

The "Request failed with status code 500" error should be resolved.
